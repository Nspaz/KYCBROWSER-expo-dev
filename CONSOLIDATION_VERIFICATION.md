## Recommendations for Maintenance

1. **Branch Strategy**
   - Keep 2-branch model: main (stable) + cursor/kyc2 (development)
   - Create feature branches only when needed
   - Merge quickly to prevent accumulation

2. **Regular Cleanup**
   - Delete merged branches immediately
   - Run `git fetch --prune` weekly
   - Monitor branch count monthly

3. **Pull Request Workflow**
   - Merge or close PRs within 48 hours
   - Avoid long-lived draft PRs
   - Use automated consolidation for 5+ stale branches

4. **Future Consolidations**
   - Use provided scripts as templates
   - Document consolidation decisions
   - Maintain consolidation reports

---

## Artifacts Generated

1. `COMPLETE_CONSOLIDATION_REPORT.md` - Full consolidation report
2. `CONSOLIDATION_VERIFICATION.md` - This verification document
3. `consolidate-branches.sh` - Reusable consolidation script
4. `merge-results.txt` - Detailed merge logs
5. `delete-log.txt` - Branch deletion logs

---

## Final Confirmation

**The repository has been successfully consolidated from 69 branches down to 2 branches, achieving a 97.1% reduction and meeting the goal of "almost 1 branch".**

All features, bug fixes, and enhancements from the 67 deleted branches have been properly merged and are present in the current state. The repository is clean, synchronized, and ready for streamlined development.
